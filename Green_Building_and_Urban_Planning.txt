Green building and urban planning play crucial roles in mitigating the impacts of climate change by fostering environmentally conscious and sustainable practices within the built environment. Sustainable architecture and design prioritize the use of eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient systems, and innovative technologies that minimize the carbon footprint of buildings. This approach not only reduces energy consumption but also enhances the overall environmental performance of structures. Additionally, the incorporation of green spaces in urban areas contributes significantly to climate resilience. Parks, gardens, and green rooftops not only provide recreational spaces for residents but also serve as carbon sinks, absorbing pollutants and promoting biodiversity. Transportation and city planning are equally important components of sustainable urban development. Designing cities with efficient public transportation systems, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and bike lanes reduces reliance on fossil fuel-driven vehicles, lowering emissions and improving air quality. By integrating these sustainable practices into urban development, communities can create more resilient, healthier, and environmentally friendly living spaces.
